## Data on the Web

    - Unstructured Data
        - Web pages
        - Trees
        - Posts
        - etc
        - How do you capture the symantics of this data?

## Web INformation Management

    Theory, design, and implemenation of info systems for large-scale information
        - Process
        - Organize
        - Analyze

    - Search engines
    - Recommendation systems

## History of Search Engines

    - 1999
        - Google
            - Page Rank -> Secret weapon
            - Capture link structure of the web page
            - Measure the relevance

## Search Process

    - How good is the result?
    - Measure the relevance

## Some Core Concepts

    Query Representation
        - Bridge lexical gap: system and systems; create and creating
        - Bridge semantic gap: car and automobile

    Document Representation
        - Internal representation of document contents: a list of documents that contain specific words
        - Representation

    Retrieval Model

## Applications

    Web Information Management: applications
        - Web Search
        - Recommendation System
        - Information Organization; document clustering
        - Information extraction: deep analysis of natural language

## Why WIR or Information Retrieval

    - Information Retrieval mainly studies unstructured data:
        - Text in web pages or emails; image; audio; video; protein sequences...

## IR vs Database

    Relational Database Mangement Systems (RDBMS)
        - Semantis well defined
        - Complex query languages
        - Exact retreival

    Information retrieval (IR):
        - Unstructured objects
        - Simple query languages (natural language query)
        - Should get what you wnat, even with bad query
        - Effectiveness is the primary issue, although efficiency is important

## Recommendation Systems

    Book
        - Recommend based on your purchase history (and others')

    Movie
        - Netflix - predict other movies you'll love

    News

    User Feedback
        - User ratings - explicit
        - Give weight to improve recommendations
        - Implicit - more data
            - Not as reliable

    Text Categorization

    Training Data
        - news content <-> category
        - function to map the content to the category
        - breaking news

    Document Clustering
        - Labels


    Information Extraction

    Entity Search

## Why Entity Search

    User Demand
        - More than 50% of web search queries target entitites

    Web Science and technology
        - Sophisticated web mining techniques
        - Data in Semantic Web naturally centered around entitites
        - [indure](www.indure.org)

    Question Answering
        - Search engines are good at answering questions

    Social Network Analysis

    Multimedia Retrieval

    Trending Topic Discovery
        - Analyze queries
        - Cloud Computing

## Sentiment Analysis

    Positive or negative movie review?
        - unbelievably disapppointing
        - full of zany characters and richly applied satire
        - greatest screwball comedy
        - pathetic
