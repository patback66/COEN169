## Models

  VSM - sim(d,q)
  LM - query likelihood P(Q|D)
    Smoothing

      - add-one
      - Dirichlet
      - Linear

    Unigram language model

      - Retrieve each word inpependently
      - There is also higram
      - Trigram
      - n-gram

      - P(W_1 W_2 W_3) = P(W_1)P(W_2)P(W_3) unigram
                     - = P(W_1|W_2)P(W_2|W_3)P(W_3) bigram

## Query Likelihood Retrieval Model

    - with linear interpolation smoothing

## Outline

    - Introduction to language modeling
    - language modeling for information retrieval

## Baye's law

    - P(A|B) = (P(B|A)P(A))/P(B)
    - P(Q|D) P(D) = P(Q_D) = P(D|Q)P(Q)
    - P(D|Q) = (P(Q|D)P(D))/P(Q)
      - but P(Q) is the same for all of the document
      - therefore alphaP(Q|D)P(D)
      - P(D) is prior
      - Query independent probability

## Document Prior

    - P(D|Q) alpha P(Q|D) * P(D)
    - Anything that affects the likelihood that a document is relevant to any document
      - popularity
      - authority
      - amount of content (e.g. length)
      - sum(P(D_i)) should sum up to 1
    - Normalize?
      - P(D_j) = score(D_j)/Sum...

  Click-rate

    - # of click on the document / # of click on any document

  URL depth

    - website entry-pages tend to be more popular
    - count the number of "/" in the URL

  Document Authority

    - endorsements
    - scientific - citations
    - web search -
    - blog search -
    - twitter search -
    - review search -

  Hub score

    - # outlinks

## Topical Focus

    - Example: blog retrieval
    - Objective: favor blogs taht focus on a coherent, recurring topic
    - VSM?
    - Plot all articles in the vector space
      - If they are all similar, they should be clustered densely
      - Compute centroid of articles, measure similarity between article and centroid
        - if it's high, then the articles talk about the same topic

## Ex: Click rate

    - P(D|Q)...
    - But if P(D) is zero, then everything is 0
    - SO USE SMOOTHING
    - Ex: P(D) = # clicks on doc / # clicks + N - # docs

## Sample midterm will be on camino

    - OFFICE HOURS WED 4-5
    - SINGLE SIDED CHEAT SHEET
    - CAN BRING A CALCULATOR

## Page Rank

## Link Structure of the Web

    - Importance of a page based on links
    - Important webpage has many in-links
    - A link from an important page should be important too
    - Quality and quantity matter

## Intuition

    - a page is important if many important pages exclusively link to it
    - PR(A) = PR(B) + PR(C)
    - Many outgoing links will dilute the contribution from c to a
      - want an exclusive endorsement
    - PR(B) = PR(C)/5
    - A << B, C
    - B << C
    - D << C
    - C >> 5
    - Sum of all page ranks should = 1

## PageRank Calculation

## Example 1

    - 3 websites
    - Yahoo >>  Amazon
    - Amazon >> Yahoo, Microsoft
    - Microsoft >> Amazon
    - PR(A) = PR(Y) + PR(M)
    - PR(Y) = PR(A)/2
    - PR(M) = PR(A)/2
    - PR(A) + PR(M) + PR(Y) = 1
    - PR(A) = .5
    - PR(Y) = .25
    - PR(M) = .25

## Example 2

    - Yahoo >>  Amazon, Yahoo
    - Amazon >> Yahoo, Microsoft
    - Microsoft >> Amazon
    - PR(A) = PR(Y)/2 + PR(M)
    - PR(Y) = PR(A)/2 + PR(Y)/2
    - PR(M) = PR(A)/2
    - PR(A) + PR(M) + PR(Y) = 1
    - PR(A) = PR(Y)
    - PR(A) = 2PR(M)
    - 2PR(M) + PR(M) + 2PR(M) = 1
      - 5PR(M) = 1
      - PR(M) = 1/5
    - PR(M) = 1/5
    - PR(A) = 2/5
    - PR(Y) = 2/5

## Example 3

    - PR(X) is not linked to, so = 0 and does not effect the others
