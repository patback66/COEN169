## FINAL REVIEW

    - Similar style to midterm
    - Basic, conceptual questions
    - Longer, more in depth

### 1 Summarize the intuition following in one sentence

    1) User-based collaborative filtering
      - Similar users rate similarly
    2) item-based collaborative filtering
      - Looking at items instead of users
      - Similar items will be rated similarly
      - Apply same algorithm to transpose of the algorithm

    - KNN

### 2

    What is the major disadvantage of using RMS to evaluate the performance to evalueate the performance of recommendation systems and why?

        - Difference between ground truth and your prediction
        - RMSE = sqrt(sum(r_i = r_i_hat)^2/n)
        - Prediction: 3, Ground Truth: 5
        - vs Prediction 3, Ground Truth: 1
        - Can't differentiate between these two cases
        - More useful for regression/classification problems
        - No under/over
        - Not exactly the same problem
        - Better metric: ranking based like precision, NDCG

### 3

    Where does K-means not work?

        - When the centroid cannot be represented
        - Requires gaussian - normal distribution
        - Doesn't work for nonlinear
        - Concentric circles - same centroid, can't differentiate

### 4

    Suppose ...

        - Categories C: American, Not American
