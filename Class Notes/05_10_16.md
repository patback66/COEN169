## What's the intuition of the page rank

    - quantity, quality, exclusiveness

## Random Walks on the Web

    - after many random walks, the visit rate is the page's page rank
    - Problem: What if you get stuck at a dead end?
    - Teleporting fixes this issue
    - 0.8 following a typical path, 0.2 random jump to any website
        - small probability, but there will be no dead end

    - PR(j) = sum(PR(i)/L(i))
        - L(i) = # of outgoing links of i
        - need to modify for teleporting
    - PR(j) = 0.8sum(PR(i)/L(i)) + 0.2(1/N)
        - n is total number of websites

## Google Solution to Traps: Teleporting

    - at a dend end, jump to a random web page
    - random jumping - applied to any website
    - new equation ex: v = 0.8Mv + .2 * 1/3

## Power Method for PageRank with teleporting

    - v1 = dMv0 + (1-d)/n * I
    - I is a vector with all ones
    - ||v_n - v_n-1|| < eta where eta is a small value

## Twitter Person Importance

    - graph of who follows who - directed graph
    - apply page rank, efficiency, quantity, quality

## Important Person on Facebook

    - same way, page rank

## The Web as a directed graph

    - anchor text -> any link
      - describes the content of d_2
      - text surrounding the hyperlink

## Link farm

    - spamming links to increase the pagerank of member pages
    - SEO - search engine optimization

## Google Bombs

    - search with bad results due to maliciously manipulated anchor text

## Questions

  Measure the similarities between webpages based on link structure?

    - Measure similarity of two pages by overlap of toher pages linking to them

## Recommendation Systems

## Types

    - editorial
    - Simple aggregates
      - top 10, most popular, recent uploads
    - Tailored to individual users
      - Amazon, Netflix

## Recommendation Algorithms

    - Collaborative filtering
    - Content-based recommendation
    - Hybrid methods

## Collaborative Filtering

    - observe user-item preferences
    - predict new preferences
    - PERSONALIZED RECOMMENDATIONS

## Data and Taks

    - Set U={U_1, ..., U_m} of m users
    - set I={i_1, ..., i_n} of n items
    - set R={r_u,i| of ratings/preference}
      - eg 1-5, 1-10, binary
    - Task:
      - recommend new items for an active user a
      - usually formulated as a rating prediction problem
      - find neighbors - similar users
        - similar users ragte similar, have similar tastes, entries

## User-based Collaborative Filtering

    - consider the active user a
    - find k other users whose ratings are similar to a's ratings
    - estimate a's ratings based on ratings of the k similar users
    - called the k-nearest neighborhood method

    - k
    - u1 5 0.9
    - u2 4 08
    - (5(0.9)+4(0.8)/(0.9_0.8)) weighted average
