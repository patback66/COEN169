## Collaborative Filtering

    - Active user a on target item i
    - Predict rating r_a_i
    - ranking problem similar to web search
    - Can use ranking based metrics to evaluate

    1) Compute Similarity W_a_u
      - cosine similarity
      - pearson correlation
      - euclidean distance between 2 ratings
        - take inverse of the distance 1/(d_a_u+1)
      - Jacard similarity (binary)
        - intersection / union
    2) Find k most similar users
      - take the top k most similar users
      - what if the users didn't rate the target movie?
      - or if similarities are very low
      - based on |w_a_u|
      - negative correlation still helps
    3) Predict

  Improvements

    1) IUF
    2) Case Amplification
      - w_a_u = w_a_u * |w_a_u|^1.5

## Calculating similarity

    - cosine sim
    - pearson
    - euclidean distance
    - small adjustments can make a big difference

## User-based Collaborative Filtering

    - similar users rate similarly

## Item-based Collaborative Filtering

    - look at similar items
    - similar items will be rated similarly

## User-Based vs itemBasedCosine

    - Efficiency
      - the latter is usually more efficient than the former
      - mosre users than items
    - Effectiveness
    - Look at rows vs columns of matrix
    - Major bottleneck: finding the k similar items

## Custom Approach

    - aggregate from other individual approaches

## Cold Start Problem

    - new items or users have no historical ratings

## Content Based Recommendations

    - Recommend items based on content
      - text documents are recommended based on a comparison between their content and a user profile
    - ex:
      - linkedin's job recommndations
    - in many applications, user profiles are not available
    - unable to exploit quality judgements of other users

## Netflix: Ratings Data

## Lessons Learned

    - combining results from various methods works surprisingly well
