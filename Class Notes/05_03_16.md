# COEN 169 Web Infrastructure

## Midterm

    - up to basic pagerank algorithm
    - Given a web structure, calculate the page rank
    - Short and conscice answers
    - Some calculation questions
    - Office hour 4-5 Wednesday

## Page Rank example

    - PR(Y) = PR(Y) * 1/2 + PR(A) * 1/2 + PR(M) * 0
    - PR(A) = PR(Y) * 1/2 + PR(A) * 0 + PR(M) * 1
    - PR(M) = PR(Y) * 0 + PR(A) * 1/2 + PR(M) * 0
    - PR(Y) + PR(A) + PR(M) = 1
    - PR(A)=PR(M)=PR(Y)=1/3

    - PR(i) = sum(PR(j))/L(j)
        - quantity, quality, exclusivity
        - the summation is about quantity
        - PR(j) => quality
        - L(j) = > exclusivity

    - keep solving for values, plug them into the rhs of equations
        - work until convergence
        - solution will not improve past that point
        - PR(Y)=2/5 * 1/2 + 2/5 * 1/2 + 0 = 2/5
        - PR(A) = 2/5 * 1/2 + 0 + 1/5 = 2/5
        - PR(M) = 0 + 2/5 * 1/2 + 0 = 1/5
    - No matter the initial values, they still converge to the same final values
    - extract the constants into a matrix, M
    - M = [1/2 1/2 0]
        - [1/2 0   1]
        - [0   1/2 0] a 3 x 3 matrix
    - V, a 3 x 1 matrix
    - v = Mv
    - so
    - M = [1/2 1/2 0] [PR(Y)]
        - [1/2 0   1] [PR(A)]
        - [0   1/2 0] [PR(M)]
    - v = Mv
        - lambda = 1, eigenvalue is 1
    - M_i_j = {0   ; if no link from j to i //ORDER IS IMPORTANT
            - {1/L ; L is # of out links of j
              - sort of the contribution of j
              - depends on # number of outgoing links - more divides it more

  Example

    - Suppose page j links to 11 pages, including i
    - v = Mv
    - v_0 = (1/3, 1/3, 1/3)
    - plug into rhs until v_t+1 = v_t
    - convergence as long as the difference is less than a small value
    - ||V_t+1 - T_t|| < Epsilon, somehting like 0.0001
    - POWER METHOD
    - v_1 = Mv_0
    - v_2 = MV_1 = MMv_0 = M^2v_0
    - v_3 = MM^2v_0 = M^3v_0
    - ...
    - v_t+1=M^(t+1)v_0
    - still need to check the difference, which must be small

## Page Rank

    P(D|Q) is P(Q}D)P(D)

      - query likelihood LM is P(Q|D)

## Random Page Walker

    - randomly follow links out of a randomly selected starting page
    - determine page rank based off of random jumps
    - iterate
    - transition probability
    - teleporting -> teleport to a random page, don't get stuck in a loop```
