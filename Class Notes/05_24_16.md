# COEN 169 Information Management 05_24_16

## More Contests/Systems

    - Kaggle
    - KDD cup
    - TREC - 20TB
    - Heritage Health prize

## User and Item based CF

## K Nearest Neighborhood

    - User-based collaborative filtering
      - similar users rate similarly
    - Item-based Collaborative fitlering
      - similar items are rated similarly

    1) Similarity calculation
    2) Neighbor Selection
    3) Prediction

  Modifications

    - IUF
    - Case Amplification

  Self Testing

    - divide training data - you have the ground truth

  Centering your data

    - include the required rating in average calculation
    - smoothing
      - global average
      - Dirichlet smoothing - get the shrunk mean

## Movie vectors

    - give values, can project as vectors
    - two factors: seriousness, for male
    - These are machine learned, not defined
    - Latent factors - not explicitly defined by humans
      - learned from the data
      - P_u - user latent factor
      - Q_i - machine latent factor
      - r_ui - P_u dot Q_i
      - Variable you want to estimate, best approximate the observed rating

## Diversity

    - Measure the ability of recommender system to cover users' different interests
    - Recommendation results should not come from single reason
    - Improving recommendation lists through topic diversification

## Serendipity

    - A recommendation result is serendipity if:
      - don't have strong relation with user's historical interest, or user do not expect we can recommend it
      - novelty to useruser will find it's interesting after user views it

## Trust

## Robustness

    - prevent attack

## NEW TOPICS

## Text Classification

    - Task
      - Assign predefined categories to text documents, giventhe existing documents and their categories
    - Motivation:
      - reduce the hughe cost of manual text categorization
        - millions of dollars spent for manual categorization
        - manual categorization is almost impossible for some large scale application
          - like web pages

## Rochio

    - for text categorization
