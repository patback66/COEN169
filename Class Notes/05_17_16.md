## Recommendation Systems

    - a good recommandation is one that can discover interesting/new items

## Collaborative Filtering

    - Predict new ratings
        1) Compute similarity between active user (r_a_i) and all the other users
        2) Select K most similar users
        3) Make the prediction


    - ways to compute similarity
        - cosine similarity for wa_i
    - Pearson correlation

## Pearson Correlation

    - choose k similar users, accoutn for 1 to -1
    - 0 correlation is useless
    - -1 good for prediction

## Evaluating Predictions

    - RMS error

## Universally liked movies

    - can't always be a good judge for the users
    - Less common movies better judge for similar movies

    - weights
      - like TF * IDF
      - IUF
        - inverse user frequency
      - IUF - log(N/)

## Improving Predictions

    - IUF - inverse user frequency
    - Penalize universally liked movies
    - universally liked as less common movies
      - movie with very low variance

    - Case amplification
      - transform appplied ot weights
      - emphasize high weights and punsh low weights
      -
