## Zipf's Law

    - statistical, not physical
    - Relationship between frequency and rank
      - f * r = k

## Heap's Law

## Evaluation

## F-Measure

    - range \[0-1]

## Discounted Cumulative Gain

    - Precision vs recall
    - Precision is preferred - want the most relevant, won't dig thorugh the rest
    - Good combined metric
    - Precision vs DCG in web search?
      - DCG may have more at the first page
      - Take into account partial relevance, order in which results occur
      - Emphasis on retrieving highly relevant documents

## Normalized DCG

    - Most important for web searches

## Benchmarks

    - Benchmark collection contains
      - Set of standard documents and queries/topics
      - List o frelevant documents for each query

## Early Test Collections

## The TREC Benchamrk

    - Text REtrieval Conference
    - Current Tasks
      - Chemical
      - Crowdsourcing Track
      - Entity Track
      - Legal Track
      - Medical Records Track
      - Microblog Track
      - Session Track
      - Web Track

## The Project

    - Based off of Lemur toolbox

## New Slides: Retrieval Models, Boolean Retrieval

## Relevance

    - Different ways to measure
    - Topic, freshness, diversity, etc
    - For now, predict topical relevante: the document is on the same topic as query

## Overview of Retrieval Models

## Boolean Retrieval

    - Uses boolean operatinos
    - Document should fulfill for query
     ![Recall graph](Class Notes/recall.png)
    - Balance between recall and precision
    - Easy for the system (no ambiguity in query)
    - Requires uses to formulate the right query
    - User gets transparency and control
      - Lots of results -> the query is too broad
      - no results -> the query is too narrow
    - Common strategy to find the right balance
      - Too broad
        - add AND or AND NOT
      - Too narrow
        - add OR constraints

## The Binary Full-Text representation

    - document-term matrix

## Processing a Boolean Query

    - Jack AND Jill
    - Jack && Jill
    - where Jack == 1 && Jill == 1
    - Create table with results for each element of the query
    - Bitwise operations, very efficient

    - Jack AND (up OR down)
    - Get intermediate results

## Ranked Boolean

    - Count occurences of query
    - tf = term frequency (# of times the term appears in the document)
    - 10, 1, 16 for "North AND Carolina"
    - North OR Carolina: 10,
    - University AND North AND Carolina or UNC
      - 1: 4, 10: 1, rest: 0
      - OR UNC
        - 1,4
        - 10,1
        - 16,4
        - 33, 2
        - 56,10
      - So
        - 1
        - 1,8 -> 2nd
        - 10,2 -> 4th
        - 16,5 -> 3rd
        - 32,2 -> 4th
        - 56,10 -> 1st

## Sparse Representation of an Inverted List

    - Don't want a huge corpus
    - Variable length inverted lists
      - Represent only the 1's
      - each document has a unique identifier (docid)
      - df = number documents in which the term appears at least once
    - Why store df in the index?

## Best Match Retrieval Models

    - Previous were exact-match
    - Now best-match
    - Predict the degree tot which a document is relevant to a query
    - Ideally, RELEVANT(q,d)
    - In practice, SIMILAR(q,d)
    - How compute the similarity between q and d?

## Vector Space Model

## What is a Vector Space

    - Like a coordinate system
    - Set of linearly independeent basis vectors
    - THe basis vectors correspond ot the dimensions or directions of the vector space

## BInary Text Representation

    - 1 = the word appears in the document
    - 0 = the word does not appear in the docuemtn
    - Does not represent word frequency, word location, or work order information

## Vector Space Representation

    - V denote the size of the vocabulary
    - easy: "dog man bite"
      - contain all 3 words (1,1,1)
    - Use binary weights
    - Any span of text can be represented as a vector
    - Can use distance between points to measure relevancy
      - angle
      - Dot product
