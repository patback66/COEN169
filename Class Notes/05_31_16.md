        - both sides
    - Format and style are similar to the midterm exam
    - Office hours Tuesday 2-3 pm
        - Additional Office hours Wed 4PM

## Recap

    - Text Classification
        - Supervised learning
        - Spam detection
        - Paul Graham - Y Combinator
        - Evaluation
            - eventually need to evaluate how good the algorithm is
            - define the classification metric to evaluate different models/algorithms
            - Precision
            - Recall
            - F-metric
            - Accuracy
            - RMSE - error rate
    - Text Clustering
        - Unsupervised
        - Naive bayes
        - Language Modeling
            - concatenate documents in the same category into one big category
        - k = sqrt(N/2)
            - number of clusters - ad-hoc rules
        - k-Means
            - need to specify K - how many clusters
            - iterative - 2 steps
                - Need to initialize the centroids before starting the process
                    - sensitive to the initial points
                    - different initial points may give different clustering results
                - Step 1: Reassignment of cluster membership
                    - based on current centers
                - Step 2: Recompute the centroid
    - Science, Nature
    - Limits of k-means
        - nonlinear data

## NOTHING MORE ON THE EXAM

## Hadoop

    - Doug cutting at Yahoo - 2004
    - Came from Google's MapReduce
    - Architecture
        - Mapreduce | Spark | ...
        - DS: Yarn
        - FS: HDFS
    - Largest: 40,000 nodes
        - functionsMap(k1,v1) -> list(k2,v2)
        - shuffle: redistribute data based on the k2
        - reduce: process the data that has the same key
    - Map -> shuffle -> reduce
        - map puts them together
            - {santa, clara, university}
            - {santa, clara}
            - {santa, Clause}
        - shuffle groups
            - {santa, santa, santa}
            - {clara, Clara}
            - {clause}
            - each gets sent to a different machine
        - Reduce
            - aggregate the counts locally, then generate the final result
            - santa, 3
            - clara, 2
            - clause, 1
            - all done in parallel, in different machines
        - map and reduce can be done in parallel

    ```
        function map(String name, String string)
            for each word w in document
                emit(w, 1)

        function reduce (String word, List values)
            sum = 0
            for each v in values
                sume += 1
            emit(word, sum)
    ```
